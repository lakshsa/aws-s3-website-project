Step: Designing a Website for Hosting

In this initial step, we focus on crafting a website that is ready for hosting on AWS. You have two options: either design a personalized website from scratch, tailoring it to your preferences and needs, or expedite the process by selecting an existing template.

If you opt for the latter, you can explore a variety of free templates available at free-css.com. These templates serve as a great starting point, allowing you to modify and customize them to suit your specific requirements.

Remember, the goal is to create a website that you'll later host using Amazon S3 and connect with a custom domain through Amazon Route 53.
