In this project, I delved into the fundamental aspects of AWS Web Hosting, focusing specifically on Route 53 and S3 Deployment. Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of what I accomplished:

1. Domain Acquisition:
Started by obtaining a custom domain to establish a distinct online presence.

2. Website Creation:
Designed and developed a website tailored to the desired content and functionalities.

3. S3 Bucket Hosting:
Hosted the website by creating and configuring S3 buckets, utilizing AWS's powerful static hosting capabilities.

4. Content Deployment:
Uploaded the website files to the designated S3 bucket, ensuring a seamless deployment process.

5. Public Accessibility:
Configured the S3 bucket to allow public access, enabling visitors to view the website content.

6. Route 53 Integration:
Leveraged Amazon Route 53 to establish both root and sub-domains, effectively directing traffic to the designated domain name for an optimal user experience.
